# Chicago_Crime_Stats_Shiny_App

This is a R Shiny app that I created for a class assignment. The data are about crime incidents in Chicago, Illinois. The following tabs only present information for 2018.

Tab 1: Frequency of crime by month and crime type. Bar charts for different month crime type combinations.
Tab 2: Location of crimes by date on a map.
Tab 3: A heatmap using the type of crime and the hour of the day when the crime was committed.
