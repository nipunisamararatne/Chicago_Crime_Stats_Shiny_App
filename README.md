# Chicago_Crime_Stats_Shiny_App

This is a R Shiny app that I created for a class assignment. The data are about crime incidents in Chicago, Illinois. The app has 3 tabs and only present information for 2018. 

Tabs:
1. Frequency of crime by month and crime type. Bar charts for different month crime type combinations.
2. Location of crimes by date on a map.
3. A heatmap using the type of crime and the hour of the day when the crime was committed.
